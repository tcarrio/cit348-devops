<h1>What This Is:</h1>

<p>The DevOps stack is a stack of services for developers to use that enhance their productivity. This DevOps stack consists of a version control service, Gogs; a project management platform, Taiga; and a continuous integration service; Drone. These help a developer maintain their code, perform testing, and collaborate with others.</p>

<h3>The Stack</h3>

<p>Currently the project consists of two servers with a shared PostgreSQL service with separate databases for the Gogs and Taiga services.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL and Gogs are hosted on tom.ou.carrio.me while Taiga{-front,-back,-events} is hosted on chase.ou.carrio.me</p>

<h3>A Visual Representation of the Stack</h3>

<p><img src="assets/stack-diagram.png" alt="DevOps Stack"></p>

<p>The <code>tom.ou.carrio.me</code> server is running both the PostgreSQL service as well as Gogs. The PostgreSQL service has 3 databases that have been initialized for all services in the stack, <code>drone</code>, <code>taiga</code>, and <code>gogs</code>. </p>

<p>The <code>chase.ou.carrio.me</code> server is running Docker containers for the Taiga stack and Drone. The Taiga stack includes Taiga-front-dist, Taiga-back, Taiga-events, Redis, Rabbitmq, and Celery. </p>

<p>These services can be visited at the links as mentioned at the top!</p>

<p>All relevant scripts and files are available under the <code>/assets/code</code> directory, and are simply the <code>tom_backup</code> and <code>chase_backup</code> directories merged for ease of access. </p>

<h3>Some Examples of the Services In Action</h3>

<p>In Gogs, perusing a mirrored repository from GitHub</p>

<p>In Drone, after setting the build settings for projects under user tcarrio, they're now listed for ease of access</p>

<p>Taiga, still being difficult with the PostgreSQL backend, but up and running.</p>
