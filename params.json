The PostgreSQL service has 3 databases that have been initialized for all services in the stack, `drone`, `taiga`, and `gogs`. \r\n\r\nThe `chase.ou.carrio.me` server is running Docker containers for the Taiga stack and Drone. The Taiga stack includes Taiga-front-dist, Taiga-back, Taiga-events, Redis, Rabbitmq, and Celery. \r\n\r\nThese services can be visited at the links as mentioned at the top!\r\n\r\nAll relevant scripts and files are available under the `/assets/code` directory, and are simply the `tom_backup` and `chase_backup` directories merged for ease of access. \r\n",
